You can use this program to interact with the ADXL345 Accelerometer using your
Raspberry Pi.

What you do need is the python-smbus library, if you don't have this library yet
you can install it using:
```
	sudo apt-get install python-smbus
```
	
Once you've installed smbus you can import ADXL345.py in your own python programs.
you have to make sure that ADXL345.py is in the same directory as your python program.
